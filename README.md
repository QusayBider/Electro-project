# Electro-project
This study investigates the design and analysis of a voltage threshold detection circuit using operational amplifiers, diodes, and a transistor. The primary objective is to establish the correct resistor values in the circuit to achieve specific upper and lower threshold voltages (VUT and VLT ).
